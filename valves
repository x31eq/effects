Based on the 6L6 vacuum tube, the 6550 was designed to have higher output power and better stability. It operates with a maximum plate voltage of 600VDC, a screen voltage of 400VDC, and plate dissipation of 35 watts.[8] The KT88, KT90, and 6550, although not identical, are often interchangeable, dependent on external circuit parameters.

The Vox AC30C2 amplifier uses:

* 2 x Premium Grade JJ ECC83 (also called 12AX7) preamp valves.
* 1 x Premium Grade Selected and Balanced JJ ECC83 for the phase splitter position in V3.
* 4 x Premium Grade JJ EL84 perfectly matched power valves/power tubes.

...

The Vox AC30 C2 amp became available in early 2010. This is a 30-watt class A all-tube amp. It is comprised of three 12AX7 tubes and four EL84 tubes.  This is the 2-speaker version of the C1.

Different for this model is that the valve rectifier was replaced with a solid-state version. So whereas the old amp used a GZ34 rectifier valve, when you change your valves oj the C2 there is no rectifier valve to change – all solid-state now.
