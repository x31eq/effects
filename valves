Based on the 6L6 vacuum tube, the 6550 was designed to have higher output power and better stability. It operates with a maximum plate voltage of 600VDC, a screen voltage of 400VDC, and plate dissipation of 35 watts.[8] The KT88, KT90, and 6550, although not identical, are often interchangeable, dependent on external circuit parameters.
